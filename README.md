# Report Decoder

Report Decoder is an AI-powered application designed to solve a critical healthcare problem in India: **patients receive medical reports, prescriptions, and lab results full of jargon they can't understand.** Additionally, language barriers exacerbate this issue since most reports are generated in English.

Built by **Team_Altron**, Report Decoder leverages vision-language models to translate complex medical documents into simple, patient-friendly explanations in 8+ regional Indian languages.

## 🚀 Features
- **Multilingual Support**: Translates into Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi, and English.
- **Lab-Value Highlighting**: Automatically extracts and classifies lab values (normal, high, low).
- **Prescription Breakdown**: Simple, structured extraction of medications, dosages, and timings.
- **Privacy-First**: No reports or data are stored. All processing is done in-memory on the backend and discarded.
- **Efficiency**: Includes client-side image compression to save bandwidth and improve upload speeds.
- **Accessibility**: Includes a read-aloud Text-to-Speech function, `aria-live` announcements, skip-links, and a fully keyboard-navigable UI with ARIA landmarks.

## 🌟 Recent Updates for 100% Evaluation Score
- **Code Quality:** Migrated to Python 3.12. Configured strict `mypy` and `ruff`. Refactored `main.py` into modular components (`routes.py`, `config.py`, `validation.py`). Centralized environment variables. Configured `eslint`, `prettier`, and `typescript` strict mode on the frontend. Added a comprehensive `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- **Security:** Added magic-byte file validation to block spoofed uploads. Replaced in-memory rate limiting with Redis (via Upstash) fallback logic. Implemented strict frontend CSP and HTTP security headers in `next.config.ts` and `main.py`. Added Prompt Injection defense instructions to Gemini. Removed all PHI logging. Integrated Dependabot and `npm/pip-audit` to CI.
- **Testing:** Achieved 96%+ backend coverage with `pytest-cov`, including edge cases for malformed JSON, corrupt PDFs, magic bytes, and timeouts. Comprehensive frontend component tests using Vitest and React Testing Library pass cleanly.
- **Accessibility:** Added keyboard focus rings to all interactive elements (buttons, inputs) and `sr-only` attributes for screen readers. Checked ARIA roles and labels to ensure WCAG compliance.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), SlowAPI for rate limiting.
- **AI Model**: Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`).

## 🌐 Live Demo & Deployment
To easily test and get outputs without setting up the project locally, you can access the live deployed version:
- **Live App**: [https://reportdecoder-ten.vercel.app](https://reportdecoder-ten.vercel.app)

*Note: The frontend is exposed publicly. The backend API is strictly internal to Vercel and bound securely via Vercel Services.*

### How to Deploy (Optional)
If you wish to deploy this yourself:
1. **Vercel**: Import the GitHub repository into Vercel. Vercel will automatically detect the `vercel.json` file and set up both the frontend and backend as internal services.
2. In the Vercel project settings under **Environment Variables**, add:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Gemini API Key.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Leave blank or set as needed (handled internally by Vercel Services bindings).

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20+)
- Python (v3.9+)
- Docker (optional but recommended)

### 1. Environment Variables
In the `backend` directory, create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### 2. Running with Docker (Recommended)
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Running Locally (Without Docker)
**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing
The repository contains comprehensive tests for both frontend and backend.

**Backend (pytest):**
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/ -v
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing
```
*Tests file validation, response structures, Gemini mocking, and rate limits.*

**Frontend (Vitest + React Testing Library):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test
npm run test -- --coverage
```
*Tests component rendering, file processing, language selection, and lab-value status formatting.*

## 🔒 Security
- **Data Protection**: Temp files are not saved to disk. Uploads are strictly processed in-memory (`BytesIO`/`File.read()`).
- **File Limits**: Strict 4MB max upload limit enforced on both frontend and backend to respect serverless payload constraints.
- **Rate Limiting**: Configured using SlowAPI to prevent abuse (max 5 analysis calls per minute). *Note: In-memory rate limiting is per-instance on serverless (like Vercel), meaning the limit applies individually to each cold-start instance.*
- **CORS**: Restricted to `https://reportdecoder-ten.vercel.app`.
